# UK LLC File 1 Integrity Checker
This repositiory contains source code, executatbles and a record of testing for the UKLLC file 1 checker and associated user interface.
## Purpose
The File checkers are user tools to help data managers bring their file submissions in line with the 
requirements set out in “UK LLC File Formatting Guidance for Depositing Data in the UK LLC Resource”. 

The checker verifies that field names and values are of expected syntax and data type. It makes no judgement on the contents
of the files other than their legality under formatting rules. It is very important that File 1s are cleared through the checker 
to avoid complications loading them into the UK LLC databank. 

## User Guide

Documentation for running the checkers is available in [File Checker User Guide.pdf](https://github.com/UKLLC/File-Checker/blob/main/File%20Checker%20User%20Guide.pdf) 
or a video walkthrough is available on our [YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/C3UN4FDNDWk).
