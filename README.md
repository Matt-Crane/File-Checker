# UKLLC File Checker
This repositiory contains source code, executatbles and a record of testing for the UKLLC file 1 checker and file 2 checker.
## Purpose
The File checkers are user tools to help data managers bring their file submissions in line with the

the UK LLC v1.9”. 

Both checkers conduct several checks on the file name, file formatting and file contents where appropriate.
